libhugetlbfs (2.23-5) unstable; urgency=medium

  Glibc 2.34 dropped support for __morecore hooks needed to support
  hugepage-backed malloc in libhugetlbfs. As a result, libhugetlbfs
  will be unable to supports this functionality without significant
  development effort.

  libhugetlbfs provides other features that are not dependent on
  __morecore hooks and continue to work. To continue providing
  supported features to the users, this version makes the backward
  incompatible changes to disable __morecore dependent features. The
  hugepage based malloc is the biggest casualty among these.

  An alternative solution for users wanting to use hugepage backed
  allocation is to use glibc 2.35. Newer versions of glibc introduced
  the ability to allocate from hugepage backed pages by using the
  tunable 'GLIBC_TUNABLES=glibc.malloc.hugetlb'.
