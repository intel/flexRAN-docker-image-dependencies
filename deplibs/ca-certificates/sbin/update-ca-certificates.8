.SH NAME
update-ca-certificates \- update /etc/ssl/certs and ca-certificates.crt
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B update-ca-certificates
.RI [ options ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
This manual page documents briefly the
.B update-ca-certificates
command.
.PP
\fBupdate-ca-certificates\fP is a program that manages the collection of
TLS certificates for the local machine and generates ca-certificates.crt.
ca-certificates.crt is a single-file of concatenated certificates.
The collection of individual certificates is stored at /etc/ssl/certs.
.PP
The program reads the configuration file /etc/ca-certificates.conf. Each line
gives a pathname of a CA certificate under /usr/share/ca-certificates that
should be trusted. Lines that begin with "#" are comment lines and thus ignored.
Lines that begin with "!" are deselected, causing the deactivation of the CA
certificate in question.
.PP
Certificates must be in PEM format and have a .crt extension in order to be
included by update-ca-certificates. Furthermore, all certificates with a .crt
extension found below /usr/local/share/ca-certificates are also included and
implicitly trusted.
.PP
To add one or more certificates to the machine, copy the certificates in PEM
format with the *.crt extension to /usr/local/share/ca-certificates. There
should be one certificate per file, and not multiple certificates in a single
file. Then run update-ca-certificates to merge the new certificates into the
existing machine store at /etc/ssl/certs.
.PP
Before terminating, \fBupdate-ca-certificates\fP invokes
\fBrun-parts\fP on /etc/ca-certificates/update.d and calls each hook with
a list of certificates: those added are prefixed with a +, those removed are
prefixed with a -.
